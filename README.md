TinDog is a funny and inspiring start-up idea.


I made Tindog in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp with HTML5&CSS and Bootstrap 4.6.
Website is responsive so you're welcome to check it with your tablet or mobile phone!

So this web page is actually my first ever page that I built and I like the fact that I can build responsive websites such as Tindog!
