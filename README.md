TinDog is a funny and inspring start-up idea.


I made Tindog in Angela Yu's Web Development with HTML5&CSS and Bootstrap 4.6.
Website is responsive so you're welcomed to check it with your tablet or mobile phone!

So this web page is actually my first ever page that i built and I like the fact that I can build responsive websites such as Tindog!
